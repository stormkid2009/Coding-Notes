/* "serving static assets"
the static assets needed by your application (stylesheets, scripts, images).
  we can use middleware for it:
  >>> express.static(path), 
  where the path parameter is the absolute path of the folder containing the assets.

  middleware needs to be mounted using the method app.use(path, middlewareFunction).
  The first path argument is optional. If you donâ€™t pass it, 
  the middleware will be executed for all requests.
  */

  //normal usage:
  app.use(express.static(__dirname + "/public"));

  //Assets at the /public route
  app.use("/public", express.static(__dirname + "/public"));

  //interesting thing here that if we can include our html file in folder with assets
  //app.use will serve it normally
  app.use(express.static('./public'));
  //if we want to use logger for all our routes simply above code
  const logger = require('./logger');
  app.use(logger);
  //or specify certain path
  app.use('/api/v1',logger)

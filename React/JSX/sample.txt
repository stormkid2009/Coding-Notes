Title " JSX "
 
 *JSX stands for javascript xml:

<Code >
const el= <p>this is not html </p>
</Code>
    simply we can render (el) to the DOM as a tag
    ok let's say it's javascript and xml which made this for us
    short and simple code  better than use createElment method.
    
<Code>
const el = <div className="main"></div>
</Code>

    we use className for element attribue because 
    the name is already reserved to ES6 class.


<App />
    notice the self close for JSX elements.

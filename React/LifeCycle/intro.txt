Title : " component's life cycle "

React provide us with methods or hooks during certain points 
during the life cycle of components.
1- Mount to the DOM>>>> it is the first cycle in component's life.
2- Update  >>>> changes happend to it and need to re render again.
3- UnMount >>>> will be removed from the dom.

for the class component we have 3 main methods:

componentDidMount(){

}

componentDidUpdate(){

}

componentWillUnmount(){

}

for functional component we have :

useEffect(
    ()=>{
        our call back function
    }

    //we can mimic willunmount hook by return a function to remove event listenrs 
    return ()=>{
        we can unsubscribr component's activity here
    }
,[]);
the empty array as second argument to tell react to render this only one time in the life cycle
of our component.

if we need to re render according to certain dependency we just add it instead of empty array
that dependency maybe state .

*the second way to make Component is ES6 class
it is useful for many features like local state and life cycle method.
*notice that react hooks can do the same things like class.


<Code>
class App extends React.Component{
    constructor(props){
        super(props);
    }
    render(){
        return(
            <div>this is class Component</div>
        );
    }
}
</Code>

important information should be add here:

"author": "information about the creator of the project"
"description":"information about the project"
"keywords":["array of words related to our project"]
"license":"information for user telling him what permission he has with our project">>>"MIT /BSD" for
open source project
"dependencies":"information about software needed for our project"
>>>>>"package-name":"version"
version>>>> "MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH" like
"express":"4.14.0"
This means that PATCHes are bug fixes and 
MINORs add new features but neither of them break what worked before. 
Finally, MAJORs add changes that wonâ€™t work with earlier versions.
we need package free bugs with the latest patch to do so : add tilde(~) as prefix to package version
"package-name":"~4.14.0"
if we need  both MINOR updates and PATCHes the caret(^) will allow this.
"package-name":"^4.14.0"

But what if you want to remove an external package that you no longer need? 
 just remove the corresponding key-value pair for that package from your dependencies.

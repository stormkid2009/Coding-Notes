//it iformes next js how many pages should pre-render in build time
//via paths object which contain  array of params represent the dynamic pageId
it returns an object with required paths key
paths is array of objects [{params:{pageId:`page path`}},{{}},......]
>>>> fallback:false ?
1- the paths returned from getStaticPaths will be rendered to HTML at build time
   with getStaticProps.
2- any paths not returned from getStaticPaths will result in a 404 page.

set fallback to false is suitable for application with small number of paths to pre-render.

>>>> fallback : true?
1- the paths returned from getStaticPaths will be rendered to HTML at build time
   with getStaticProps.
2- the paths have not been generated at build time will not result in a 404 page.instead,
   Next.js will serve a "fallback" version of the page on the first request to such a path.
3- in the background,Next.js will statically generate the requested path HTML and JSON,
   this includes running getStaticProps.
4- when that's done,the browser receives the JSON for the generated path.this will be used to 
   automatically render the page with the required props .from the user's perspective,the page
   will be swapped from the fallback page to the full page.
5- at the same time,Next.js will keep track the new list of pre-rendered pages.Subsequent requests
   to the same path will serve the generated page,just like other pages pre-rendered at build time.

>>>> fallback:"block"?
1- the paths returned from getStaticPaths will be rendered to HTML at build time
   with getStaticProps.
2- the paths have not been generated at build time will not result in a 404 page.instead,
    on the first request to such a path,Next.js will render  the page on the server and return
    generated HTML.
3-when that is done,the browser receives the HTML for generated path,from the user's perspective:
   "browser is requesting the page" ->>>>> "the full pages is loaded" (there is no flash of loading/fallback state).
4- at the same time,Next.js will keep track the new list of pre-rendered pages.Subsequent requests
   to the same path will serve the generated page,just like other pages pre-rendered at build time.

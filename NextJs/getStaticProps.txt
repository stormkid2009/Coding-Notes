1- 
   getStaticProps runs only on the server side 
   the function will never run on client side
   the code we write inside getStaticProps won't be included in the JS bundle that is sent to the browser

2- 
   we can write server-side code directly inside getStaticProps
   accessing the file system using FS module or quering database can be done inside it
   we dont have to worry about API keys as they won't be sent to the browser

3- 
   getStaticProps is only allowed inside pages route and can not be written inside regular component
   it is used only for pre-rendering and not client-side data fetching

4- 
   getStaticProps should return an object and this object contain props key which is an object too

5- 
   getStaticProps will run at build time
   during development it will run on every request

********************************************

- any Link component (initially or through scroll) will be prefetched by default
  (including the corresonding data) for pages using Static Generation

- when a page with getStaticProps is pre-rendered at build time,in addition of the HTML file,
   next-js generates JSON file holding the result of running getStaticProps
   the JSON file will be used in client-side routing through next/link or next/router

-  when you navigate to a page that's pre-rendered using getStaticProps,next-js fetches
   the JSON file (pre-computed at build time) and use it as the props to create the page
   at the client-side

- client-side page transitions will not call getStaticProps as only the exported JSON is used

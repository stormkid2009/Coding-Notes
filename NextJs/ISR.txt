Incremental Static Regeneration

there was a need to update static pages after building which needed change without having to rebuild the whole application.
to avoid problems after building app [data updated in DB and not in the app "stale data"]
well the solution is to add revalidate key directly in the function getStaticProps after props object.
<code example>

export async function getStaticProps(){
    return{
        props:{},
        revalidate:10   >>>> 10 second here to revalidate we can change it as we need
    }
}

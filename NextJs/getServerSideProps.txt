well this is the second type of pre-rendering which deals with server-side
as it is clear we can write backend code directly here
pre-rendering will be with every request for data
Next-JS give us this wonderful async function to deal with backend code
code in general will be 10% statically with getStaticProps
and 90% with getServerSideProps for dynamic app
this is an example for our function and how it works:

<<Code example>>

export async function getServerSideProps(context){
    const {params} = context
    const {category} = params
    const response = await fetch(`http://localhost:4000/news?category=${category}`)
    const data = await response.json()

    return {
        props:{articles:data},
        category,
    }
}

notice that we will send {articles,category} as params to our page function to deal with data

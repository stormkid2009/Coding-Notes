                       ***Pre-rendering and data fetching***
**what does pre-rendering mean?
Nextjs generates HTML for each page in advance in advance instead of having all done with client-side JavaScript

<<First example>>
no Pre-rendering(plain React.js-app):
[initial load]             >>>        [Hydration]
 app is not rendered    >js loads>     React components are initialized and app becomes interactive

 <<Second example>>
Pre-rendering( Next.js-app):
[Initial Load]             >>>        [Hydration]
 pre-rendered HTML     >js loads>     React components are initialized and app becomes interactive
 is displayed

** why Pre-render?
1- it improves performance:
   - in React app u need to wait for javascript to be excuted
   - perhaps fetching data from external API then render UI
   - there is a wait time for the user
   - with pre-rendering HTML is already generated and loads faster

2- It Helps with SEO:
   - In case of Blod Or E commerce site SEO is a concern
   - in React app when Search engine spiders crawl to ur page it will see only a div with id root
   - but in Next app they will find all content is present in ur source code which will help indexing ur page
<<Types of Pre-rendering>>:
1- Static Generation
  - without data
  - with data >> the HTML can be only generated after fetching external data
  - incremental Static generation
  - dynamic parameters when fetching data

  ** what is static generation?
   - Method for generating html pages at build time
   - page can be built once, cached by  a CDN and served to the client almost instantlly
   ex: Blog pages,E commerce products pages,documentation and marketing pages

 ** how to make static generation?
  Next js do it by default for every page in our app
  the HTML for every page will automatically be statis generated when we build our application

  <<Production Server>>
  an optimized build is created once and you deploy . You don't make code changes on the go once it is deployed

  <<Development Server>>
  we should be able to make changes in our code and we want our code immediately to reflect in the browser

  for production mode>> a page will be pre-rendered once we hit the build command
  for development mode >> page will be pre-rendered with every request we make

2- Server-side rendering
 - data fetching

Client-side data fetching
Combining pre-rendering with client-side data fetching

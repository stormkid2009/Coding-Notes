what is redux?
simply is predictive state container,
the only source of truth for state .
what are the components of redux?
store>>> where we can store our data
action>>> it describes what we need to do/update with state
reducer>>> it does the work to update/modify state
    reducer take state and action as arguments
    reducer itself is an argument to the method Redux.store(reducer)

ok we can deal with multi state's elements
and many actions.

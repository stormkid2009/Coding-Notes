what is redux?
simply is predictive state container,
the only source of truth for state .
what are the components of redux?
store>>> where we can store our data
action>>> it describes what we need to do/update with state
reducer>>> it does the work to update/modify state
    reducer take state and action as arguments
    reducer itself is an argument to the method Redux.store(reducer)

ok we can deal with multi state's elements
and many actions.
here is the steps of working with redux as counter example:

// 1) Create a new Redux store with the `createStore` function
const store = Redux.createStore(counterReducer)

// 2) Subscribe to redraw whenever the data changes in the future
store.subscribe(render)

// Our "user interface" is some text in a single HTML element
const valueEl = document.getElementById('value')

// 3) When the subscription callback runs:
function render() {
  // 3.1) Get the current store state
  const state = store.getState()
  // 3.2) Extract the data you want
  const newValue = state.value.toString()

  // 3.3) Update the UI with the new value
  valueEl.innerHTML = newValue
}

// 4) Display the UI with the initial store state
render()

// 5) Dispatch actions based on UI inputs
document.getElementById('increment').addEventListener('click', function () {
  store.dispatch({ type: 'counter/incremented' })
})
